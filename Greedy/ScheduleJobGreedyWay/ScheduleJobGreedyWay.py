'''
The jobs.txt file describes a set of jobs with positive and integral weights and lengths. It has the format

[number_of_jobs]

[job_1_weight] [job_1_length]

[job_2_weight] [job_2_length]

For example, the third line of the file is "74 59", indicating that the second job has weight 74 and length 59.

You should NOT assume that edge weights or lengths are distinct.
